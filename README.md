Fourth try making a programming language. Last time had some hiccups on assembling the AST, clanky type correction and scope. This time hoping I'll get further :D

Compilation Steps (v2 = Version 2 in progress)
- File Reader
- Lexer (v2)
- Parser (v2)
- Type Inferrer
- LLVM Code Generator
- Assembly Compiler
- Code Runner
