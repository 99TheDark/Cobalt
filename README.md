# Sulfur
Fourth try making a programming language. Last time had some hiccups on assembling the AST, clanky type correction and scope. This time hoping I'll get further :D

Sulfur is a statically and weakly typed programming language written in Go.

Inspired by Go, JavaScript, Rust, Julia, Odin, Zig, C#, Swift, Java and Kotlin
