# Sulfur
Fourth try making a programming language. Last time had some hiccups on assembling the AST, clanky type correction and scope. This time hoping I'll get further :D

Inspired by Go, JavaScript, Rust, Julia, Odin, Zig, C#, Swift and Java

Compilation Steps 
- File Reader
- Lexer
- Parser (REDO)
- Type Inferrer (REDO)
- LLVM Code Generator (REDO)
- Assembly Compiler
