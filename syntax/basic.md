# Basic Structures
- Comments
    ```
    // Comment
    
    /*
    Multi-line comment
    */
    ```
- Groups
    ```
    // Anything inside of braces is a group, and has scope 
    {
        // code omitted
    }
    ```
- Array
    ```
    // Arrays literals are made from the type, and filled with brackets
    float[] myArray = float[3.7, -6.4, 12.9, 5.0]
    ```
- Operation Assignment
    ```
    int x = 5

    // x = x + 2 (append)
    x += 2

    // x = 1 - x (prepend)
    x =- 1
    ```
- Inference
    ```
    // x is a float
    x := 8.9

    // pi and otherPi are both int[]'s
    pi := [3, 1, 4]
    otherPi := int[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
    ```
