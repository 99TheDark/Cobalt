# Basic Structures
- Comments
    ```
    // Comment
    
    /*
    Multi-line comment
    */
    ```
- Groups
    ```
    // Anything inside of braces is a group, and has scope 
    {
        // code omitted
    }
    ```
- Array
    ```
    // Arrays literals are made from the type, and filled with brackets
    let myArray = float[3.7, -6.4, 12.9, 5.0]
    ```
