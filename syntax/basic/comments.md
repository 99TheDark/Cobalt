## Comments
A comment is used to write your own "comments" about your code, without it affecting what happens. You can write a single-line comment, taking only one line, by adding `//` before what you'd like to write.
```
// Comment
```
You can make a multi-line comment, which can take up any number of lines, by surrounding your message with `/*` and `*/`.
```
/*
